How to use:

Read the intruction carefully. Use at your own risk. I dont responsible for
any bricks if you do not follow step by steps below.

1. You must use Habib 4.50 CFW.
2. Make back up of sys_init_osd.self
   How to : using multiMAN mmOS on PS3, navigate to dev_flash/sys/internal and find file named:
   sys_init_osd.self. Copy this file to your USB or your PC and safe it in secure location.
4. Extract zip on your PC. You will find 2 files : sys_init_osd.self and sm.self.
5. Now using multiMAN, enable write access to dev_flash (on multiMAN, 
   go to Settings -> Write Access to /dev_flash -> Enable
6. Copy sys_init_osd.self to your PS3. Copy it to:
   dev_blind/sys/internal  (replace the old sys_init_osd.self).
7. Copy sm.self to your PS3. Copy it to the root of  dev_blind.
8. Turn off your PS3, unplug all usb drive.
9. Turn on your PS3. 
10. Check your PS3 Power Indicator LED, if it is yellow (with green LED after few seconds then yellow again); 
   it indicates that the fan control is working fine.If your PS3 cannot boot to XMB; it indicates your PS3 is 
   semi brick and you cannot use CFW Tools because it is not compatible with your PS3.

11. I also include core for fast booting, copy "flags" Folder into Root of a FAT32 Flash memory.
    Turn off your Ps3
    Connect your Flash memory to the nearest port to Blu-ray drive.
    then Turn on your PS3
    This greatly improves the boot time.

12. If you want to change fan speed in sm.self, you can download PS3 CFW Tools at:

13. If you want to prevent a USB device "sleep" create a file "nosleep" in root of the device (whether measured 0 bytes)
14. If you want to uninstall System manager, Just replace sys_init_osd.self with original one.

##IMPORTANT TO RECOVER SEMIBRICK CONSOLE
if you have semibrick when test this tools, use this procedure to recover it:
a.	Copy file sys_init_osd.self from your backup in Step 3 to the root of FAT32 USB Drive.
b.	Turn Off PS3.
c.	Insert your USB/External HD to your PS3 in your right port (Closest to the Blue Drive).
